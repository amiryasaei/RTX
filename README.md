For Project3, we have two parts. The first part has a main that contains a practice for using mutexes. The second part has another main file that uses IMU and works with BRENT.

Since we cannot have two main files at the same time, I have put the main file for first part in another folder in project 3. In order to use them, simply replace main files.
